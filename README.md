# Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive set of tools for analyzing and visualizing clinical and blood biomarker data. The goal of this project is to apply machine learning and statistical techniques to uncover patterns in health-related datasets, specifically for analyzing blood biomarkers.

The project demonstrates how to:

Load, clean, and preprocess health-related data

Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction

Visualize correlations between biomarkers and features

Apply clustering (K-means) to identify groups or patterns in the data

Use Random Forest Classifier to evaluate feature importance and make predictions

Conduct statistical tests to find significant differences between groups
